(ABSTRACT)

Fog machines enhance emergency responder training by simulating low-visibility conditions and creating controlled 
environments for research and testing purposes.The circuit design will be simple and user-friendly, allowing non-technical 
users to operate and adjust the fog maker without complications.

(INTRODUCTION)

The fog maker machine is to generate mist or fog by using ultrasonic vibration. The machine will convert electrical 
energy into ultrasonic waves, which agitate water to produce fog. This system is controlled using a 555 timer IC, and the
design will focus on efficient operation, simplicity, and component optimization to produce a reliable fog generation 
system.
