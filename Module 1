ABSTRACT 

The Skin Response Meter is an electronic circuit designed to measure changes in skin resistance, which varies based on 
a person's emotional state. By monitoring the skin's electrical conductivity, the device provides real-time feedback on 
stress levels and relaxation effectiveness. This tool is valuable for tracking physiological changes related to emotional 
stress and can aid in relaxation training and stress management.

INTRODUCTION 

A device that enables continuous, accurate monitoring of physiological responses. The circuit employs a sensitive
amplifier to convert skin resistance into a measurable voltage, which is then displayed through a meter and LED indicators. 
The device will be designed for individuals seeking to monitor and manage their stress levels.
